Pros:
--> Bridges the gap between elegance and complexity
--> Reduces the need for complex loops an auxiliary data structures
--> Can reduce time complexity easily with memoization
--> Works really well with recursive structures like trees and graphs

Cons:
--> Slowness due to CPU overhead
--> Can lead to out of memory errors/stack overflow exceptions
--> Can be unnecessarily complex if poorly constructed
