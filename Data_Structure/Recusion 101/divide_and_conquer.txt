1) Divide problem into several smaller subproblems. Normally, the subproblems are similar to the original

2) Conquer the subproblems by solving them recursively. Base case: solve small enough problems by brute force

3) Combine the solutions to get a solution to the subproblems. And finally a solution to the original problem

4) Divide and Conquer algorithms are normally recursive
