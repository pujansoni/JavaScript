// Trees are just a special kind of graph with one root and only one unique path between any two nodes
// A graph can go beyond that and have any number of root elements and multiple path between nodes
// Time complexity to find adjacent nodes - O(e) where e is the number of edges
// Time complexity to find if two nodes are connected - O(e)
// Space complexity -> O(v+e) where v is the number of vertices and e is the number of edges
