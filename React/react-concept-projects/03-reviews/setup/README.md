Here we used useEffect to fetch the data in the previous project. In some examples we will use the local data while in the other examples we will use fetch data
We will later on use a custom hook to fetch the data called useFetch to fetch the data to avoid repetition

We have used the React Icons package for this project (https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
