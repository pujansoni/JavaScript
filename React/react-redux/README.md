Redux demo project

Redux: A Complex State Management Tool, with a single store as CDS (Central Data Store)

Reducers: Manages the State and Returns the newly updated state

Actions: Actions have 2 properties type: which is a unique identifier and payload which has data

Dispatch: Dispatch is used to send actions to update the data

We need to install two redux libraries in order to get started with redux:
npm install redux react-redux

Here in this project we will create the index.js file inside the store directory in src folder in which we will handle all the state used in the project

The syntax of the state used in the redux is similar to the useReducer
