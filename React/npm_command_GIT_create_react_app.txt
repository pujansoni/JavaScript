NOTE WHILE PUSHING THE PROJECT TO GITHUB:
It's important NOT to push the node_modules folder in the GITHUB as it's a large folder.
When we take the pull from the GITHUB we can use the "npm install" command to install all the dependencies

The create-react-app (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) provides a starter project where we can create the boiler plate code for the react application. It uses Babel and WebPack under the hood.
Babel is a JavaScript Compiler that converts the ES6 JavaScript code to ES5 JavaScript which supports in older browsers as well.
The main feature of WebPack is bundling the resources, watching for changes and running Babel.
