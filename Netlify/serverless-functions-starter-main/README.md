# Netlify Serverless Functions

Here the netlify-cli package is insalled in the dev environment. Alternatively, we can also use the -g flag to install the netlify-cli globally and use the **ntl dev** or **netlify dev** command to invoke the dev server

Here as we have installed the **netlify-cli** package locally and we have set the **netlify** option in **scripts** in the **package.json** file which invokes the dev server we can also use the command **npm run netlify** to invoke the dev server
